    "Historically students find this the most difficult of the Physics units in the foundation year. These notes are provided to help supliment your lectures and should act as a useful tool for your understanding and revision. \n",
    "\n",
    "**These notes contain worked solutions to example problems.** Ensure you try to answer the questions before looking at the solutions. Research has shown that when students simply look at the solutions they get a false sense of understanding e.g \"Yes, that is what I would have done.\", but when tested are unable to perform as they haven't gone through the process of actually learning the steps to answering the questions themselves! \n",

    "**Practise, Practise, Practise!** This is the most effective way to boost understanding in Physics and Maths.\n",

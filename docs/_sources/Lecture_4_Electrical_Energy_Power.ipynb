    "Power is defined as *the rate at which work is done*. As work is measured in Joules it is a unit of energy, as such the previous statement can be defined mathematically as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta t}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P$ is the power, $E$ is energy and $t$ is time. We may also recall that voltage or *electric potential*, $V$, is defined as the electrical energy per unit charge:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta Q}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are to divide both sides of the equation above by $\\Delta t$, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{V}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta Q \\Delta t}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "multiplying the $\\Delta t$ term from the left hand side to the right hand side gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{\\Delta E \\Delta t}{\\Delta Q \\Delta t} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta t}\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta Q}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we established that the $\\frac{\\Delta E}{\\Delta t}$ is simply equal to the power, and $\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta Q}$ is simply the reciprocal of the current. As such the expression above may be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\frac{P}{I}, $$\n",

    "When we supply electrical power to a device, we expect it to use that energy to do something useful. For example, when I turn on a light I expect that electrical energy to be converted into light energy to illuminate a space. This light energy is useful energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of that electrical energy will also be converted into other types of energy. Taking my light as an example, should I be using an old incandescent bulb, the vast majority of the electrical energy will be converted into heat energy via resistive heating in the tungsten filament. If my aim is to illuiminate my room this is not useful energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency, $\\eta$, of a device is the measure of how much energy it converts into useful energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\eta = \\frac{\\text{useful energy out}}{\\text{total energy in}}. $$\n",

    "If we have an incandescent bulb supplied with $60\\,$ J of electrical energy and it produces $10\\,$ J of light energy, the efficiency of the bulb is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\eta = \\frac{10 \\, J}{60\\, J} = 0.167, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "therefore the bulb has an efficiency of 16.7%. \n",
    "\n",
    "This calculation can also be flipped on its head. Let's assume that this bulb is actually being used to heat up a chicken coop meaning now the useful energy is the thermal energy it kicks out, which assuming there are no other energy losses would be equal to $50\\, $J:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\eta = \\frac{50 \\, J}{60\\, J} = 0.833, $$\n",

    "In the lecture, the nature of magnetic fields (**B-fields**) and the forces they exert on charges is going to be introduced. Although we often do not think about magnetism in our day to day lives, magnetic fields permiate all around as any moving charge produces a magnetic field. Let's first consider the magnetic field that you are currently being exposed by at this very moment - the magnetic field produced by the Earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the earth is made from molten iron and nickel, which move following convection currents (which we will look at in the thermal physics module). These convection currents produce a magnetic field. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This field has an approximate strength of $25$ - $65\\, \\mu T$ at the Earth’s surface and can be modelled approximately as a bar magnet, with the magnetic north and south pole aligned with the geographic poles. The unit $T$ is known as **Tesla**. Most magnetic fields are in the micro to milli range and the strongest electromagnet on Earth produces a field of $~45\\, T$. Often the unit Gauss is used instead (G → 1G = 10-4 T).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnetic north pole is more closely aligned with the geographic south pole. The magnetic poles move around the earth and have actually flipped several times throughout the history of the planet. The last time was ~42,000 years ago. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/BPoles.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth’s magnetic field deflects charged particles from the solar wind, protecting us from radiation and the ozone layer from depletion. Many charged particles are deflected to the poles where they interact with atmospheric constituents - this is the origin of the Aurora! \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the Earth acts similarly to a bar magnet. If a bar magnet is surrounded by iron filings, they will orient themselves along the *magnetic field lines* produced by the bar magnet. In the case of the Earth, solar charged particles will follow the the magnetic field lines produced by the Earth, which creates bands of radiation known as the Van Allen belts. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/BarMagnetField.png)\n",
    "![](Figures/VanAllen.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Magnetic field lines are directional and in a bar magnet move from the south pole to the north pole. As magnetic fields have both magnitude and direction, they are another example of a *vector field*.\n",

    "\n",
    "The occurance and strength of aurora is dependant on the amount of charge particles that the sun is emitting into space. The intensity of solar particle emission follows an eleven year cycle, and at the time of writing, the *solar maximum* is approaching (estimated to be between late 2024 and early 2026). \n",
    "\n",
    "This means you may get the chance to see the northern lights in Sheffield during your studies. There are many apps that help you gauge the best chance of seeing them in person - it may be worth downloading one! It helps to go somewhere dark to see them, but thankfully we are located next to the peak district.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [May of 2024](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1ej1kk0d88o), a large sun spot was oriented towards the Earth and produced a strong *geomagnetic storm* that induced aurora as far south as continental Europe. An unusually strong geomagnetic storm combined with a clear night sky is very rare...

    "## Moving Charges and Magnetic Fields \n",
    "\n",
    "Magnetic fields are produced by moving charges, for example, electrons are they move through a wire. In this example, the shape of the magnetic field produced will be dependant on the shape of the wire. The shapes of these magnetic fields can again be shown using iron filings or compasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/BFieldWire.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the magnetic field produced by the straight wire. You will notice that the field lines are form concentric rings around the wire rather than straight lines permiating from it as is the case for an electric field. In order to determine the direction of a magnetic field produced by moving charges we use the one of two **right hand rules**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Right-hand-rule-2** states that the the direction of a magnetic field produced by a current carrying wire can be determined by making a thumbs-up with your right hand. The direction that the thumb is pointing represents the direction that the conventional current is flowing, and the direction that your fingers are pointing (curled) represents the direction of the magnetic field lines. This is shown in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/RHR2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The direction of the field is same whether considering many charges moving through a wire, or a single charge moving through free space. **The direction of the B-field will always be perpendicular to the direction of motion of the charge (its velocity)**. The strength of the magnetic field will decrease at increasing radial distance from the wire. The closer the field lines are together, the stronger the magnetic field. You will also note that the *magnetic field vectors* are always tangental to the field lines. This is true for both charges moving in a wire and individual (positive) charges moving through free space, as illustrated below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/WireField2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the wire is reshaped it will produce a different shape mangetic field. For example if the wire is looped over and over again like a spring, the contribution to the magnetic field from each coil forms a larger overall magnetic field as shown in the figures below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Figures/BFieldShapes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A coil of wire like this is known as a solenoid.** A solenoid is an example of an electromagnet. The strength of the magnetic field produced is dependant on the amount of current flowing through the wire and where the measurement of the field is taken from. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Important\n",
    "*Amperes law* allows us to derive formulae for the magnetic field strength for different wire configurations. \n",

    "If magnetic fields are produced by moving charges, you may be wondering how fixed magnets, like a bar magnet,\n",
    "are magnetic. Essentially these are moving charges on a quantum scale. The charges in atoms (electrons and protons) are in orbitals, meaning when they move in these orbits they they act as tiny magnets. When the *magnetic moments* of many atoms become alligned, their magnetic fields add together to produce the permenant field produced by the bar magnet.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is known as the vector cross product. We use this simply because to determine the force, we are only interested in the components of the charges velocity that are perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The magnetiude of the force is greatest when the velocity of the charge and the B-field are perpendicular to one another:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F = Bqv \\sin{\\theta_{v,B}}, $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F = Bqv \\sin{90}, $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F = Bqv \\cdot 1,$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F = Bqv. $\n",

    "When the the velocity of the charge is parallel to the direction of the B-field (they're moving in the same direction), the force acting on the particle is zero:\n",

    "$ F = 0\\, N $\n",

    "```{Warning}\n",
    "The equation $\\vec{F} = q\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B} $, was written using vector notation indicating that the force, velocity and magnetic field are vectors. This notation is not used throughout these notes as most of the problems you will encounter will not require you to consider the individual vector components, however, you should be aware that each of these quantities are in fact vectors.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the direction that the force on the charged particle/wire acts, we need to use another right hand rule: **right-hand-rule 1**, which is shown below:\n",

    "![](Figures/RHR1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**This right hand rule applies to a positive charge. It can also be used for a negative charge, but the force will actually act in the opposite direction!** This hand rule is consistent with *Flemming's left hand rule*, but for consistency, the two right hand rules will be used on this course. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A consequence of the force always acting perpendicularly to the velocity of the charge and direction of the B-field is that the charge will follow a circular path in a uniform magnetic field if the velocity is also perpendicular to the direction of the B-field. This is because the force caused the particle to constantly accelerate the perpendicular direction as illustrated below:\n",

    "![](Figures/BCircular.png)\n",

    "Finally, consider what would happen if a charge was placed within a magnetic field that is parallel with a coexisting electric field. The charge would be accelerated in by the electric field, whilst following a circular path due to the magnetic field. This would result in the charge following a helical path as shown:\n",

    "Magnetic fields are routinely used in particle and nuclear physics research to filter particles/nuclei of interest. This is achieved by using a magnetic field to deflect the particles, using the equation $ r = \\frac{mv}{Bq} $ it is evident that the path that the charges will follow is dependant on their charge-to-mass ratios, thus the B field can be tuned so that only the desired particles are deflected to the experimental station whilst the rest are blocked. \n",
